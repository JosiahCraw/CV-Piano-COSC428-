# Computer Vision Piano
This assignment only required the base OpenCV, I used version 4.3.0 on Arch Linux.

## Running
Two demo input files are provided, these are ironically `output.avi` and `output-1.avi` my demo is
`demo.mp4` and the code is all within `main.py`. To run the code simply run the following:

```
user@linux:~$ python main.py
```
